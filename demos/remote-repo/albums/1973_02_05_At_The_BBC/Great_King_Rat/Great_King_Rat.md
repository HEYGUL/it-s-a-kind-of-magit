Great King Rat died today

Born on the twenty first of May
Died syphillis forty four on his birthday
Every second word he swore
Yes he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?

Where will I be tomorrow?
Will I beg or will I borrow?
I don't care I don't care anyway
Come on come on the time is right
The man is evil and that is right
I told you ah yes I told you
