You might believe in Heaven
I would not care to say
For every star in Heaven
There's a sad soul here today

Wake up in the morning with a good face
Stare at the Moon all-day
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
Does anyone care anyway?
For all the prayers in Heaven
So much of life's this way

Did we leave our way behind us?
