Sammy was low, just watching the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time, he'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him, "Boy, you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions right out of your head

You should've been sweeping up the Emerald Bar"

Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
