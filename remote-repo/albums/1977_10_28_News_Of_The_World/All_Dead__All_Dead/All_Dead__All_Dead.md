She came without a farthing
A babe without a name
So much ado about nothing
Is what she'd try to say
So much ado, my lover
So many games we played
Through every fleeted Summer
Through every precious day

All dead, all dead
All the dreams we had
And I wonder why I still live on
All dead, all dead
...
