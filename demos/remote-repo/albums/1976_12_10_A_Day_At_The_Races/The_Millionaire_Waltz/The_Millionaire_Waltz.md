Bring out the charge of the love brigade
There is spring in the air once again
Drink to the sound of the song parade
There is music and love everywhere

Give a little love to me
Take a little love from me
I want to share it with you
I feel like a millionaire

Once we were mad, we were happy
We spent all our days holding hands together
Do you remember, my love
How we danced and played
In the rain, we laid
Could stay there
