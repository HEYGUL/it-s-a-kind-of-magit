You are now gonna sing, okay?
This is from the Sheer Heart Attack album

Here I stand (here I stand)
Look around around around around (look around, around, around, around)
But you won't see me (but you won't see me)
Now I'm here (now I'm here)
Now I'm there (now I'm there)
I'm just a just a new man
Yes you made me live again
A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
And the people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight
Whatever came of you and me?
America's new bride to be
Don't worry baby I'm safe and sound
Down in the dungeon just Peaches and me
Don't I love you so?
Yes she made me live again, yeah!
A thin moon me in the smoke screen sky
Where the beams of your love light chase
Don't move don't speak don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face
Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye
Down in the city just Hoople and me
...
