Seaside, whenever you stroll along with me
Merely contemplating what you feel inside
Meanwhile, I ask you to be my Clementine

You say you will if you could, but you can't
I love you madly
Let my imagination (run away) with you gladly
A brand new angle highly commendable
Seaside rendezvous

I feel so romantic, can we do it again?
Can we do it again some time (I'd like that)
Fantastic, c'est la vie mesdames et messieurs
