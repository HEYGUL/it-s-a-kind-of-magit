I make it half past six, you come at seven
Always try to keep me hanging round
You little spoilt thing, girl, you kept me waiting
Never contemplating my point of view
This comes as no surprise
I'm a fool for I believed your lies
But now, I've seen through your disguise
Who needs, well, I don't need, who needs you?

Oh, I believed you
Went on my knees to you
How I trusted you
