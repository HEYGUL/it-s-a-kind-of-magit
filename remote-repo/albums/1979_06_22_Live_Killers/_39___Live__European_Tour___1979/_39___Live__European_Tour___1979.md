In the year of '39
Assembled here the volunteers
In the days when the lands were few
And the ship sailed out
Into the blue and misty morn'
Sweetest sight ever seen

And the nights followed day
And the story tellers say
The score brave souls inside
For so many a lonely day
Sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried

Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
...
