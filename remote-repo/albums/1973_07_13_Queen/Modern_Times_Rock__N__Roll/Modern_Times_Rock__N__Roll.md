Had to make do with a worn out rock and roll scene
The old bop is gettin' tired, need a rest, well, you know what I mean
Fifty eight, that was great, but it's over now and that's all
Somethin' harder's coming up, gonna really knock a hole in the wall
Gonna hit ya, grab you hard, make you feel ten feet tall

Well, I hope this baby's gonna come along soon
You don't know it could happen any ol' rainy afternoon
