"Dislocate your spine if you don't sign," he says
"I'll have you seeing double"
Mesmerize you when he's tongue-tied
Simply with those eyes
Synchronize your minds and see
The beast within him rise

Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off
Flick of the wrist and you're dead, baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist - he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm and taken a leg
