Oh, I used to be your baby
Used to be your pride and joy, hmm
You used to take me dancing
Just like any other boy
But now you've found another partner
You've left me like a broken toy

Oh, it's someone else you're taking
Someone else you're playing to
Honey, though I'm aching
Know just what I have to do
If I can't have you when I'm waking
I'll go to sleep and dream I'm with you
