Ooh-ooh
Music is playing in the darkness
And a lantern goes swinging by
Shadows flickering, my heart's jittering
Just you and I

Not tonight, come tomorrow
When everything's sunny and bright (sunny and bright)
No, no, no, come tomorrow
'Cause then we'll be waiting for the moonlight

We'll go walking in the moonlight
Walking in the moonlight
