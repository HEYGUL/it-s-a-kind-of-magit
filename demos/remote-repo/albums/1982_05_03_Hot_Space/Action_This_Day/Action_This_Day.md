Action

This street, honey, is a mean street
Living in this street, honey, needs a mean streak
We've got criminals living in this street

But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling, this world is using me

This town, honey, is a dead town
Living in this town, honey, is a let down
Coming to this town, honey, is a showdown
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keep on pumping

Some sunshine ray through a crack in a shutter
Or a sight of a light at the end of a tunnel
