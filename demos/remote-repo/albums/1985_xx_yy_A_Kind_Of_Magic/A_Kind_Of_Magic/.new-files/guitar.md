[Chorus]

A
It’s a kind of magic, it’s a kind of magic, a kind of magic


[Verse 1]

A
One dream one soul
B7
One prize one goal
Dmaj7
One golden glance
A
Of what should be

A
One shaft of light
B7
That shows the way
Dmaj7
No mortal man
A
Can win this day

A
The bell that rings
B7
Inside your mind
Dmaj7
Is challenging
A
The doors of time

F#m7               D
The waiting seems eternity
F#m7                 E7
The day will dawn on sanity
D                 A
Is this a kind of magic
D                  A
There can be only one
E              G        D                          E
This rage that lasts a thousand years will soon be gone

A                     B7
This flame that burns inside of me
Dmaj7              A
I’m hearing secret harmonies
A                   B7
The bell that rings inside your mind
Dmaj7              A             D
Is challenging the doors of time


[Chorus]

A                   D
It’s a kind of magic
A                   D
It’s a kind of magic

A      D     A


[Verse 2]

E              G       D
This rage that lasts a thousand years
E11                         E
Will soon be, will soon be done
     D            A
This is a kind of magic
     D            A
There can be only one
     E         G       D
This rage that lasts a thousand years
             E11   E7   D
Will soon be done


[Chorus]

A                  D
It’s a kind of magic
A                  D
It’s a kind of magic
A                  D
It’s a kind of magic
A                  D
It’s a kind of magic
