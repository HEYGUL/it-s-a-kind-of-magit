One, two, three, four, one
Yeah
Okay!
Don't do it
Don't you try, baby

Don't do that, don't, don't, don't
Don't do that, you got a good thing going now
Don't do it, don't do it
Don't

Don't try suicide, nobody's worth it
Don't try suicide, nobody cares
Don't try suicide, you're just gonna hate it
Don't try suicide, nobody gives a damn

So, you think it's the easy way out?
Think you're gonna slash your wrists this time
Baby, when you do it all you do is get on my tits
