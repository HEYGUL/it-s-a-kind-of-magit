Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're taking all my sunshine away
Making out like you're the main line (I knew that)

'Cause you're a cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh, just cruising
Driving along with the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart
Feeling the beat of my heart

Ooh, you're a cool cat
Coming on strong with all the chit chat
Ooh, you're alright
