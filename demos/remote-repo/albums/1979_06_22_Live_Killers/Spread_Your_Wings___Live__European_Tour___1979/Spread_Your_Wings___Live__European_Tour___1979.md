This is called "Spread Your Wings"

Sammy was low
Just watching the show
Over and over again
He knew it was time
He'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind

His boss said to him
"Boy, you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions
Right out of your head
Sammy, who do you think that you are?
You should have been sweeping up the Emerald Bar"

Spread your wings and fly away, sing it
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
...
