This is called, "Don't Stop Me Now"

I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah
I'm floating around in ecstasy, so
Don't stop me 'cause I'm having a good time, having a good time

I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger, defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by, like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go there's no stopping me

I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man outta you

Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time, I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call
Don't stop me now
