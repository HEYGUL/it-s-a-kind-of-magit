Ooh yeah, ha, yeah
Take me to the room where the red's all red
Take me out of my head, 's what I said
Yeah, ow
Hey, take me to the room where the green's all green
And from what I've seen it's hot, it's mean
Eh

Gonna use my stack
It's gotta be Mack
Gonna get me on the track
Got a dragon on my back
