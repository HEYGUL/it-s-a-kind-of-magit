Oh, yeah
Fool always jumpin', never happy where you land
Fool got no business, take your livin' where you can
Hurry down the highway, hurry down the road
Hurry past the people staring, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry

Leave on time, leave on time
Never got your ticket but you leave on time
Leave on time, leave on time
Gonna get your ticket but you leave on time
Leave on time, leave on time
Put it in your pocket but you never can tell

Leave on time, leave on time
Shake that rattle, gotta leave on time
Leave on time, leave on time
Fight your battle but you leave on time
Leave on time, leave on time
