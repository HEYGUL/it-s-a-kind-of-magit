A word in your ear
From father to son
Hear the word that I say
I fought with you
Fought on your side
Long before you were born

Joyful the sound
The word goes around
From father to son to son

And the voice is so clear
Time after time it keeps
Calling you, calling you on
Don't destroy what you see
Your country to be
Just keep building on the ground
That's been won

Kings will be crowned
And the word goes around
From father to son to son
