Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landside
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see

I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me (to me)

Mama
Just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger
Now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Mama, oo-oo-oo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
