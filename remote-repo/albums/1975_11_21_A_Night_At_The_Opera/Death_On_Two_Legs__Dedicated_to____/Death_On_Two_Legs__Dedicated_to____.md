You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you breach
Screw my brain till it hurts
You've taken all my money, and you want more
Misguided old mule with your pigheaded rules
With your narrow-minded cronies who are fools
Of the first division

Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart of your own
Killjoy, bad guy, big-talking, small fry
You're just an old barrow boy
...
