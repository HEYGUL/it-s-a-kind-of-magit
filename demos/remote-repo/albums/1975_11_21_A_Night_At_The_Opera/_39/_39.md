In the year of '39
Assembled here the volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out
Into the blue and sunny morn'
The sweetest sight ever seen

And the night followed day
And the storytellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day
Sailed across the milky seas
Never looked back, never feared, never cried

Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
...
