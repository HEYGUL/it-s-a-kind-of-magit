I don't want my freedom
There's no reason for living with a broken heart

This is a tricky situation
I've only got myself to blame
It's just a simple fact of life
It can happen to anyone

You win, you lose
It's a chance you have to take with love
Oh, yeah, I fell in love
But now you say it's over, and I'm falling apart
Yeah, yeah

It's a hard life
To be true lovers together
To love and live forever in each other's hearts
...
