Hey
I'm gonna take a little walk on the wild side
I'm gonna loosen up and get me some gas
I'm gonna get me some action, go crazy driving in the fast lane

My baby left me alone
She done me dirty, and I'm feeling so lonely
So, come home, come home
If you don't, you're gonna break my heart

Man on the prowl
You'd better watch out
I'm on the loose, and I'm looking for trouble
So, look out (yeah, yeah), look out (yeah, yeah)
I'm a man on the prowl
