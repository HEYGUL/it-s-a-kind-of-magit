This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get 'round to it, I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love

This thing (This thing) called love (Called love)
It cries (Like a baby) in a cradle all night
It swings (Woo-ooo), it jives (Woo-woo)
It shakes all over like a jelly fish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

There goes my baby
She knows how to rock and roll
She drives me crazy
