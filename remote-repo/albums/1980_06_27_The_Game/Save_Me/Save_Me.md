It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you, how I cried
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham, it seems
The years believe we lived a lie
I love you till I die

Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, save me
...
