Can
Anybody find me
Somebody to love?

Ooh-ooh, ooh

Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

Somebody (Somebody)
Ooh, somebody (Somebody)
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love
Yeah

I work hard (He works hard)
Everyday of my life
I work 'til I ache my bones

At the end (At the end of the day)
I take home my hard-earned pay all on my own
I get down (Down) on my knees (Knees)
And I start to pray (Praise the Lord)
'Til the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

Somebody (Somebody)
Ooh, somebody (Please)
