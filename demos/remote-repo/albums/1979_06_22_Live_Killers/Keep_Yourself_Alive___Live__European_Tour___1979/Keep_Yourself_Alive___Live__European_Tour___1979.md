I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Tried to grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile

Well, I sold a million mirrors in a shopping alley way
But I never saw my face in any window, any day
Now they say your folks are telling you
"Be a super star"
But I tell you just be satisfied
And stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive, ooh
Keep yourself alive, ooh
Take you all your time and money
Honey, you'll survive

Well, I've loved a million women in a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul
