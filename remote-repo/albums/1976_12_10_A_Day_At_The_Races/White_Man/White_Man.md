I'm a simple man with a simple name
From this soil, my people came
In this soil remain, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
We made us our shoes
And we trod soft on the land
But the immigrant built roads
On our blood and sand, oh, yeah

White man, white man
Don't you see the light behind your blackened skies?
White man, white man
You took away the sight to blind my simple eyes
White man, white man
Where you gonna hide from the Hell you've made?
