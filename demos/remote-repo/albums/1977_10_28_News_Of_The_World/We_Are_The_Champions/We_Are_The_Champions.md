I've paid my dues time after time
I've done my sentence but committed no crime
And bad mistakes, I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through

And we mean to go on, and on, and on, and on

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
...
