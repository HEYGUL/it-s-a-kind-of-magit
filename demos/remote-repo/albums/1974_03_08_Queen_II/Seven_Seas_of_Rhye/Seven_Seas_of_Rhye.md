Fear me you loathsome, lazy creatures
I descend upon your earth from the skies
I command your very souls you unbelievers
Bring before me what is mine
At the seven seas of Rhye

Can you hear me you peers and privy councillors
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
I swear that you'll be mine
...
