Funny how love is everywhere, just look and see
Funny how love is anywhere you're bound to be
Funny how love is every song in every key
Funny how love is coming home in time for tea

Funny, funny, funny, oh

Funny how love is the end of the lies when the truth begins
Tomorrow comes, tomorrow brings
Tomorrow brings love in the shape of things
That's what love is, that's what love is
