Well you're just seventeen, and all you want to do is disappear
You know what I mean, there's a lot of space between your ears
The way that you touch, don't feel nothing
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it was the DNA
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that made me this way

Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel?
Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel?

Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac
