Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah

Get your party gown and get your pigtail down
And get your heart beatin', baby
Got my timin' right, I got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight, my little school babe
Your momma says you don't
And your daddy says you won't
And I'm boilin' up inside
Ain't no way I'm gonna lose out this time
Oh, no

Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosin' around
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
