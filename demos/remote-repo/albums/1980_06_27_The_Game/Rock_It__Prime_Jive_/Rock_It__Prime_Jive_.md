When I hear that rock and roll
It gets down to my soul
When it's real rock and roll

When I hear that rock and roll
It gets down to my soul
When it's real rock and roll
Oh rock and roll

Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
You really think they like to rock in space
Well I don't know

What do you know?
What do you hear
On the radio?
Coming through the air
I said Moma
I ain't crazy
I'm all right - all right
Hey c'mon baby said it's all right
To rock'n'roll on a Saturday night
