Bring back, bring back, bring back that Leroy Brown (Yeah)
Bring back, bring back, gotta bring that Leroy Brown (Yeah)
Bet your bottom dollar bill, you're a playboy (Yeah, yeah)
Daddy cool with a ninety dollar smile (Ooh, yeah)

Took my money out of gratitude
And he git right out of town
Well, I gotta getty up, steady up, shoot him down
Gotta hit that latitude, babe

Bring back, bring back, bring back that Leroy Brown (Yeah)
Bring back, bring back, gotta bring that Leroy Brown (Yeah)
Big bad Leroy Brown, he got no common sense (No, no)
He got no brains, but he sure gotta lot of style
