Oh-oh, people of the earth
"Listen to the warning," the seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here

I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hand on the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice-cold hearts of charity bare

I watched as fear took the old man's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves
"I see no day," I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal

Ah-ah, people of the earth
"Listen to the warning," the prophet he said
For soon the cold of night will fall
Summoned by your own hand

Ah-ah, children of the land
Quicken to the new life, take my hand
Fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove

He told of death as a bone white haze
Taking the lost and the unloved babe
Late too late, all the wretches run
These kings of beasts now counting their days

From mother's love is the son estranged
Married his own, his precious gain
The earth will shake, in two will break
And death all round will be your dowry

Ah-ah, people of the earth
"Listen to the warning," the seer he said
For those who hear and mark my words
