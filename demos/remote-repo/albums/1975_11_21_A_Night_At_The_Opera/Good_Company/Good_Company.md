Take good care of what you've got
My father said to me
As he puffed his pipe and baby B
He dandled on his knee
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away

Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company

Soon I grew up and happy too
My very good friends and me
We'd play all day with Sally J
The girl from number four
