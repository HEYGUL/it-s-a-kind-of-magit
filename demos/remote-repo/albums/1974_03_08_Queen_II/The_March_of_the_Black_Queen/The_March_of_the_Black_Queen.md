Do you mean it, do you mean it, do you mean it?
Why don't you mean it?
Why do I follow you and where do you go?

You've never seen nothing like it, no, never in your life
Like, going up to heaven and then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it (And the world will so allow it)
Ooh, give a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lily pool delight
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night

Here comes the black queen, poking in the pile
Fie-fo the black queen, marching single file
Take this, take that, bring them down to size
March to the black queen

Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys
A little sugar then a rub-a-dub-a baby oil
Black on, black on, every fingernail and toe
We've only begun, begun
...
