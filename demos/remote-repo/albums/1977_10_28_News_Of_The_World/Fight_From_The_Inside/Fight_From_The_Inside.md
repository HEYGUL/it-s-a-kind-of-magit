Hey you boy hey you hey you boy
Think that you know what you're doing
You think you're gonna set things to rights
You're just another picture on a teenage wall
You're just another sucker ready for a fall
You gonna fight from the inside
Attack from the rear
Fight from the inside
You can't win with your hands tied
