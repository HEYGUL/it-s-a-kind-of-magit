They called him a hero
In the land of the free
But he wouldn't shake my hand, boy
He disappointed me

So I got my handgun
And I blew him away
That critter was a bad guy
I had to make him pay

You might fear for my reason
I don't care what they say
Look out, baby, it's the season
For the mad masquerade

Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Oh, you need a bullet like a hole in the head
