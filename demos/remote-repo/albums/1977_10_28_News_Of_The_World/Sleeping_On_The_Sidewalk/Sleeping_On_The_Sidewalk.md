I was nothin' but a city boy
My trumpet was my only toy
I've been blowin' my horn
Since I knew I was born
But there ain't nobody wants to know

I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't want to go home

So 'round the corner comes a limousine
And the biggest grin I ever seen
Here, sonny, won't you sign?
Right along the dotted line
What you sayin', are you playin'?
Sure you don't mean me?
