We will, we will rock yo (Take it)
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you
C'mon, do it again
We will, we will rock you
One more time
We will, we will rock you
Yeah

Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playin' in the street gonna be a big man some day
Mud on your face, big disgrace
Kickin' your can all over the place
...
