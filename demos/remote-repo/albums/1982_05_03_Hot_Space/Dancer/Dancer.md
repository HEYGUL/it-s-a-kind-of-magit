I'm not invited to the party
Been sitting here all night
I'm all alone at the party
I don't feel all right
Ain't got no black coat
Ain't got no tie
I gotta shape up now
Come on, baby, you gotta know why

Ha, take off!
Dancer, dancer
I can't live with it, I'm gonna die without it
Dancer, dancer
Ain't no doubt about it
Dancer, dancer
Why don't you kick off your dancing shoes
And come and ride with me?
Cool

You're the life and soul of the funk-tion
It took me all night
To get hold of the right introduction
