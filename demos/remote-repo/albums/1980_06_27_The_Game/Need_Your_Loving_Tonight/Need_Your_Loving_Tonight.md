Yeah!
Hey, hey, hey

No, I'll never look back in anger
No, I'll never find me an answer
You promised me you'd keep in touch
I read your letter, and it hurt me so much

I said I'd never, never be angry with you

I don't wanna feel like a stranger, no
'Cause I'd rather stay out of danger
I read your letter so many times
I got your meaning between the lines
