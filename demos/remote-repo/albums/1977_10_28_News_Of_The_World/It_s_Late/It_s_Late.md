You say you love me
And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you in the candle light
There's no one but myself to blame

But there's something inside
That's turning my mind away
Oh, how I could love you
If I could let you stay

It's late when I'm bleeding deep inside
It's late, ooh, is it just my sickly pride?
Too late, even now the feeling seems to steal away
So late, though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time
The more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Yes, baby

Now you tell me you're leaving
...
