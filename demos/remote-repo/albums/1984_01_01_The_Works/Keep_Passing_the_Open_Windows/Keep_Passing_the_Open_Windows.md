This is the only life for me, yeah
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness, 'cause love is all you need
Love is all you need

Do you know what it's like to be alone in this world?
When you're down and out on your luck, and you're a failure
Wake up screaming in the middle of the night
You think it's all been a waste of time, it's been a bad year

You start believing everything's gonna be alright
Next minute, you're down, and you're flat on your back
A brand new day is beginning
Get that sunny feeling, and you're on your way

Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
