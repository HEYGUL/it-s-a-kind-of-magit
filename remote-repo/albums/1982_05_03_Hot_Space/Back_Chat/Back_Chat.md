Back chat, back chat
You burn all my energy
Back chat, back chat
Criticizing all you see
Back chat, back chat
Analysing what I say
Back chat, back chat
And you always get your way
Oh, yeah, see what you've done to me

Back chat, back chat
It's driving me insane
Survival to the end
Knock you down, you come again
Talk back, talk back
You've got me on the wrack
Twisting ev'ry word I say
Wind me up and get your way
Fat chance I have of making a romance
If I'm ever goin' to win
Have to get the last word in

Take it from there
Twisting ev'ry word I say
...
