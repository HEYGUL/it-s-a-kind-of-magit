Are you ready?
Well are you ready?
We gonna tear it up - yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Turn me loose it
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Wooh hoo

Hey, give me your mind baby give me your body
Yeah, give me some time baby let's have a party
It ain't no time for sleepin' baby
Soon it's round your street I'm creeping
You better be ready

We gonna tear it up
Stir it up
Break it up - baby

You gotta tear it up
Shake it up
Make it up - as you go along
