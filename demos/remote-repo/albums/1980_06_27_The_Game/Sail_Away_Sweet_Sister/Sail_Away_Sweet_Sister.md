Hey, little babe, you're changing
Babe, are you feeling sore?
Ain't no use in pretending
You don't wanna play no more

It's plain that you ain't no baby
What would your mother say?
You're all dressed up like a lady
How come you behave this way, yeah?

Sail away, sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
To love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
...
