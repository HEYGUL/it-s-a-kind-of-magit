I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way
Might to grow a little wiser
Little better every day

But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile

Well, I sold a million mirrors
In a shop in alleyway
But I never saw my face
In any window any day

Well, they say your folks are telling you
To be a superstar
But I tell you just be satisfied
And stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive, yeah
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money
But honey, you'll survive

Well, I've loved a million women
In a Belladonic haze
