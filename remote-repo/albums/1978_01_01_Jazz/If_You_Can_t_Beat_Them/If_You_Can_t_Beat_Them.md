Keep your chin up when you're feeling lonely
Don't let them get you down
Ain't no use in sitting all alone
Hangin' around for someone to call
Ohh they won't come knocking at all
Don't run and hide even if it hurts you inside
So I said give as good as you get

If you can't beat them join them
You better do it 'cos it makes you feel good
...
