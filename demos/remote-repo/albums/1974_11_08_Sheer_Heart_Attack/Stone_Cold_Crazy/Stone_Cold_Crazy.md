Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning I was dreaming
I was Al Capone
There's a rumour going round, gotta clear outta town
I'm smelling like a dry fish bone
Here come the Law, gonna break down the door, gonna carry me
Away once more
Never, never, never get it any more
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know
