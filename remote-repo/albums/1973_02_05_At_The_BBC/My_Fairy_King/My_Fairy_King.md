Aaaaa-aaaah!

In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever, oh, yeah

Lion's den with fallow deer
And rivers made from wine so clear
Flow on and on forever

Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on, on, on, on, on...
...
