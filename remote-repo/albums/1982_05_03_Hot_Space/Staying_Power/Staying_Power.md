Let me show it to you, yeah

See what I got
I got a hell of a lot
Tell me, what you feel
Is it real, is it real?

You know I got what it takes
And I can take a lot
Did you hear the last call, baby?
You and me got staying power, yeah
You and me, we got staying power
Staying power (I got it, I got it)

I wonder when we're gonna make it
I wonder when we're gonna shake it
Rock me, baby, rock me
C'mon, you can shock me
Let's catch on to the groove
